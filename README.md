# NFF TreeSitter Parser 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vhyrro/neorg/main/res/neorg.svg" width="70" height="70">

A TreeSitter grammar for [Neorg](https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg).

## Available Commands
| Command           | Result																				|
| -                 | -																						|
| `yarn`            | installs needed dependencies (only do if you don't have `tree-sitter` in your path)	|
| `yarn gen`		| `tree-sitter generate && node-gyp build`												|
| `yarn test`		| `tree-sitter test`																	|
| `yarn clean`		| removes all files generated by `yarn gen`												|

- `npm` can be used instead of `yarn`
- When `yarn` is used with no args then it's replaced with `node install`

# Features
- Has support for a very large portion of the specification.
- Has support for carryover tags
- Can show errors (yes, it can show errors in a markdown-like format, crazy)
- Isn't a massive editor hog

# Drawbacks
- Currently only uses regex notation for defining patterns. This wouldn't be a problem in e.g.
a programming language, however Neorg is a markdownesque language - it needs a more complex way of
parsing text. We do not have a custom `scanner.cc` for lexing.
- Does not support links
- Does not support attached modifiers (things like \*this\*).
- Does not inherently treat indented elements of the document as children of a node.
